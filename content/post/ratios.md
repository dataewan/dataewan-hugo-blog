Ratios are a very handy analytic tool.

# Calculating a ratio

$$
ratio = \frac{numerator}{denominator}
$$

# Interpreting a ratio

There are two things that can happen with your ratio,
it can go up or it can go down.
The interpretation of this sounds easy, right?
Not really,
there are quite a few different things that can have caused this change.

## The numerator has changed

If the numerator increases, then your ratio increases.
If it decreases, then your ratio decreases.

## The denominator has changed

If the denominator increases, then the ratio **decreases**.
If it decreases then the ratio increases.

## Both have changed, but at different rates

The previous examples all assume that when either the numerator or denominator have changed,
the other one stays the same.
Most of the time with real data both the numerator and denominator will change at once.
This is when things can get very confusing.

# Actual magnitude of change

When you're comparing different ratios,
it can often get quite confusing.
This is because ratios don't tell you about the actual magnitude of the quantities you're comparing.
If you double both the numerator and denominator,
then the ratio stays the same,
even though the actual system has changed significantly.
