[merge](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html)
is a lot like joining in SQL.
It lets you combine together different datasets.

The [full documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html) on merging is well worth a read.
I'll probably write about that at some other point.
